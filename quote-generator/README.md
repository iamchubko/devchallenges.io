## Overview

Quote generator built with React and [Quote Garden API](https://github.com/pprathameshmore/QuoteGarden). The page is responsive with attention to how site will be used on different platforms. On mobile, for example,buttons will be within reach for fingers.

## Notes

 - I didn't use [package](https://github.com/pprathameshmore/QuoteGardenNPM) provided by the API's developer because it uses obsolete version of the data, therefore I couldn't make it work. Instead, I wrote direct requests to the API.
 - The site built with React Hooks.
