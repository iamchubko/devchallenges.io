# Overview

The repository is dedicated to my solutions for designs from [devChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/). I reproduce design with code almost pixel perfectly and often add personal touches to add character or improve the overall experience.

All projects have been built with responsiveness in mind, mostly with mobile-first approach. The early ones have been created with `SCSS` and `JS`. Now, my focus shifted towards `React`, `Next.js` and such.

Each folder represents a solution. Below you can find a quick overview of solutions with accompanying notes. The order starts from the most advanced projects. For further info, navigate to the directory of interest and read accompanying `readme.md`.
