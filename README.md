## Overview

This repository is all about my solutions to DevChallenge. Each folder represents a solution. Below is the list of, you guest it, solutions with notes about it (if project deserves). The order is from the latest to the old ones.

All projects are responsive, mostly built with SCSS and JS. The description next to the project will tell if otherwise.

Each solution contains readme.md file with a short description in its own folder.
