# Overview

The repository is dedicated to my solutions for designs from [DevChallenge.io](https://devchallenges.io/). I reproduce design with code almost pixel perfect and often add personal touches myself to add character or improve the overall experience.

All projects have been built with responsiveness in mind, mostly with mobile-first approach. The early ones have been created with SCSS and JS. Now, my focus changed to React and other frameworks to speed up the development process.

Each folder represents a solution. Below you can find a quick overview of solutions with accompanying notes. The order starts from the most advanced projects. For further exploration, navigate to the directory and see `readme.md` with a description.
