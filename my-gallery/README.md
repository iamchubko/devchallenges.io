## Overview

Simple static page with responsive layout. Built with plain HTML, SCSS and JS. Deployed with Firebase.

## Features

- Images in gallery open up full size on click;
- Aspect ratio of images calculated in CSS so it's remain consistent when viewport size changes;
- Zoom animation for images on hover (not very practical because it's hardcoded);
